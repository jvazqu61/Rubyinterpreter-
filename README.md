# Ruby interpreter
Simple interpreter developed using Ruby 

Once the program is running:
    * The user will first be prompted for a file name that is in the same directory to execute.
        *** PLEASE INCLUDE THE FILE EXTENSION: e.g-> <file>.txt ***
    * The user will be prompt with "Enter a command:". The user can enter one of the valid commands
      l: Executes a line of code
      a: Executes all the instructions until a halt instruction
      q: quits program
     The user should enter a single char when prompt for the command.
